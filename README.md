# NewRelic Kubernetes Operator

__pre-alpha__ This is a work in progress to use the [operator-framework](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) to create a controller and CRDs for NewRelic.  This allows us to create New Relic resources when creating  our services such as dashboards or synthetics.
